# ATM-Payment-Application
Developing a payment application project using C language can be an interesting challenge. The project can include the following features:
## summary:  
    User account creation: The application will allow users to create accounts by providing their personal information such as name, email, and phone number. The user's account will also include their bank account or credit/debit card information.

    Payment processing: The application will enable users to initiate payments to other users or merchants. The payment processing feature will utilize secure protocols to ensure that transactions are conducted safely.

    Transaction history: The application will maintain a record of all transactions conducted by users. Users can view their transaction history and track their payments.

    Security measures: The application will include robust security measures to prevent fraud and unauthorized access. These measures can include password protection, two-factor authentication, and encryption.

    Error handling: The application will handle errors and exceptions that may occur during payment processing. The application will provide error messages that help users understand the nature of the problem and how to resolve it.
